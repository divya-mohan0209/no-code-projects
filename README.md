# My side projects

A list of some awesome projects that I've been working on (for fun!) apart from my daily job!

You could totally try the No Code projects too with ZERO (Yes, I mean it!) prior coding experience.

Most of my coding projects aren't super novel, but having a Systems Engineering background this is how I learn.

There'll be links (& if possible, resources) included to each of the projects I have made so that you can go give it a spin yourself.

If I haven't mentioned it here it is possible that there were multiple resource involved and for brevity's sake I've ignored it.

In such cases, do feel free to email me by clicking --> <mailto: divya.mohan0209@gmail.com> (Divya Mohan)
